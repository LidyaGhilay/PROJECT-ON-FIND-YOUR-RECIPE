## Description

1. Recipe Search
A person can search for recipes by typing a keyword or phrase into the search bar.
The app fetches recipes from the Edamam API based on the user's search query.
2. Recipe Display
 Recipes are displayed as interactive cards, each containing an image, title, and basic information about the recipe.
Users can easily browse through the list of recipes and quickly identify the ones they're interested in.
3. Recipe View
Clicking on a recipe card expands it to reveal more detailed information, including a list of ingredients and the number of calories per serving.
Users can toggle the visibility of the ingredients list to focus on the recipe instructions.
4. Feedback

Clear and informative messages guide users and help them make better use of the app.
